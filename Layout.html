        <p>A modern kitchen is a blend of sleek design, high functionality, and cutting-edge technology, characterized by clean lines, minimalist aesthetics, and smart use of space. The overall look is sophisticated yet practical, making the kitchen a central hub of the home.

          Color Scheme: The color palette typically features neutral tones like whites, grays, and beiges, which create a bright and airy atmosphere. Accents of bold or contrasting colors might appear through elements like backsplashes, appliances, or decorative items, adding visual interest without overwhelming the space.
          
          Cabinetry: Modern kitchens often feature streamlined cabinetry with flat-front doors and minimal hardware. Cabinets are frequently made of high-gloss or matte finishes in materials such as wood, laminate, or painted surfaces. The design focuses on maximizing storage and maintaining a sleek appearance.
          
          Countertops: Countertops are usually made from durable, high-quality materials like quartz, granite, or marble. They have a smooth, seamless appearance, often with minimal visible seams or joints. The choice of material complements the overall color scheme and enhances the kitchen’s modern look.
          
          Backsplashes: Backsplashes in modern kitchens are often simple and elegant, using materials like subway tiles, glass panels, or patterned tiles.</p>

          <h4><b>Master Bedroom</b></h4>
          <p>A modern master bedroom is a harmonious blend of sleek design and functional elegance, emphasizing clean lines, uncluttered spaces, and a sense of serenity. The color palette is often neutral—think shades of white, gray, beige, or soft pastels—with occasional pops of bold color or rich textures to add interest.
